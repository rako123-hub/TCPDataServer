Note that the .timer file has used “OnUnitActiveSec” to specify the schedule. Much more flexible is the “OnCalendar” option. For example:

# run on the minute of every minute every hour of every day
 OnCalendar=*-*-* *:*:00
# run on the hour of every hour of every day
 OnCalendar=*-*-* *:00:00
# run every day
 OnCalendar=*-*-* 00:00:00
# run 11:12:13 of the first or fifth day of any month of the year
# 2012, but only if that day is a Thursday or Friday
 OnCalendar=Thu,Fri 2012-*-1,5 11:12:13
